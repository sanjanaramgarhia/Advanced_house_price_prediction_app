🏠 Advanced House Price Prediction App

An end-to-end machine learning–based house price prediction application built using Python and deployed with Streamlit. The project predicts house prices based on key features using multiple regression models and allows interactive user input through a web interface.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning techniques. Multiple regression models were trained and compared to identify the best-performing model. The final solution is integrated into a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
